This app will be available for all under three categories:
 1. Not a breast cancer patient
 2. Breast cancer patient
 3. Survivors

WORKFLOW

On Startup we will ask the user to provide us his/her email and an option to receive important articles about breast cancer we will also use it for analytics purpose.
Next we will ask the user if he/she is not a cancer patient but doubts that they have those symptoms OR if they’re breast cancer patient OR they’ve won th fight against breast cancer.

Workflow for non-cancer patients:

If user selects the option that she is “not a breast cancer patient” but they have a doubt about that, you can simply check yourself by attempting the quiz based upon the most common symptoms of breast cancer and it predicts on the basis of your responses that you have a low, medium and high risk of getting breast cancer. Under the result we will give the option to know more about breast cancer symptoms, diagnosis and treatment. And under this we will give them an option to call a doctor or nurse who is expert in breast cancer and he can take counselling from the free of cost and get the much needed guidance at an early stage.

Workflow for cancer patients:

If you are a “breast cancer patient” then select your stage (1,2,3,4) and enter your mobile number to proceed. Here we add a unique feature where you find there is a call option where you talk to strangers like you if you are feeling lonely, your call data will be anonymous and encrypted. There is a survey for analysing the data based on risk factors. Also, it includes the details of various therapies for breast cancer such as chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy and hormonal therapy and users can ask frequently asked questions and also you contact your doctors to know more about therapies. It also includes the motivational stories of breast cancer patients and the online upcoming events/ webinars for awareness where they book their session. 

Workflow for survivors:

If you are a “survivor” in this section we add a notification system for the patient who has a previous medical history of breast cancer and also there is a section where patients enter their previous medical details. One more feature is added where our app provides a notification to the patients through email for their next “mammogram” diagnosis, they can choose as per their convenient time. “Follow up care plan” is also planned for the patients, if some patients don't have a follow up plan then we add an option where the patient contacts the expert via call to get the guidance. We also include a very unique feature of “Podcast” where survivors can share their experience by recording their audio and also listen to the audio stories of other survivor patients. Details of the awareness program are also provided where you directly register or book the session. 

SYMPTOMS OF GETTING BREAST CANCER:

- New lump in the breast or underarm (armpit).
- Thickening or swelling of part of the breast.
- Irritation or dimpling of breast skin.
- Redness or flaky skin in the nipple area or the breast.
- Pulling in of the nipple or pain in the nipple area.
- Nipple discharge other than breast milk, including blood.
- Any change in the size or the shape of the breast.
- Pain in any area of the breast.
- Keep in mind that these symptoms can happen with other conditions that are not cancer.

RISK FACTORS OF BREAST CANCER PATIENTS

*Risk Factors You Cannot Change*
   
1. Getting older.> The risk for breast cancer increases with age; most breast cancers are diagnosed after age 50.

2. Genetic mutations.> Inherited changes (mutations) to certain genes, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2. Women who have inherited these genetic changes are at higher risk of breast and ovarian cancer.

3. Reproductive history.> Early menstrual periods before age 12 and starting menopause after age 55 expose women to hormones longer, raising their risk of getting breast cancer.

4. Having dense breasts.> Dense breasts have more connective tissue than fatty tissue, which can sometimes make it hard to see tumors on a mammogram. Women with dense breasts are more likely to get breast cancer.

5. Personal history of breast cancer or certain non-cancerous breast diseases.> Women who have had breast cancer are more likely to get breast cancer a second time. Some non-cancerous breast diseases such as atypical hyperplasia or lobular carcinoma in situ are associated with a higher risk of getting breast cancer.

6. Family history of breast or ovarian cancer.> A woman’s risk for breast cancer is higher if she has a mother, sister, or daughter (first-degree relative) or multiple family members on either her mother’s or father’s side of the family who have had breast or ovarian cancer. Having a first-degree male relative with breast cancer also raises a woman’s risk.

7. Previous treatment using radiation therapy.> Women who had radiation therapy to the chest or breasts (like for treatment of Hodgkin’s lymphoma) before age 30 have a higher risk of getting breast cancer later in life.

8. Women who took the drug diethylstilbestrol (DES),> which was given to some pregnant women in the United States between 1940 and 1971 to prevent miscarriage, have a higher risk. Women whose mothers took DES while pregnant with them are also at risk.

*Risk Factors You Can Change*

1. Not being physically active: Women who are not physically active have a higher risk of getting breast cancer.

2. Being overweight or obese after menopause: Older women who are overweight or obese have a higher risk of getting breast cancer than those at a normal weight.

3. Taking hormones: Some forms of hormone replacement therapy (those that include both estrogen and progesterone) taken during menopause can raise risk for breast cancer when taken for more than five years. Certain oral contraceptives (birth control pills) also have been found to raise breast cancer risk.

4. Reproductive history: Having the first pregnancy after age 30, not breastfeeding, and never having a full-term pregnancy can raise breast cancer risk.

5. Drinking alcohol: Studies show that a woman’s risk for breast cancer increases with the more alcohol she drinks.

Research suggests that other factors such as smoking, being exposed to chemicals that can cause cancer, and changes in other hormones due to night shift working also may increase breast cancer risk.

SOME METHODS TO HELP CANCER PATIENTS TO COPING UP WITH THE DEPRESSION:

1. Exercise: Regular exercise can be as effective at treating depression as medication. Not only does exercise boost serotonin, endorphins, and other feel-good brain chemicals, it triggers the growth of new brain cells and connections, just like antidepressants do. Best of all, you don’t have to train for a marathon in order to reap the benefits. Even a half-hour daily walk can make a big difference. For maximum results, aim for 30 to 60 minutes of aerobic activity on most days.

2. Social support: Strong social networks reduce isolation, a key risk factor for depression. Keep in regular contact with friends and family, or consider joining a class or group. Volunteering is a wonderful way to get social support and help others while also helping yourself.

3. Nutrition: Eating well is important for both your physical and mental health. Eating small, well-balanced meals throughout the day will help you keep your energy up and minimize mood swings. While you may be drawn to sugary foods for the quick boost they provide, complex carbohydrates are a better choice. They’ll get you going without the all-too-soon sugar crash.

4. Sleep: Sleep has a strong effect on mood. When you don’t get enough sleep, your depression symptoms will be worse. Sleep deprivation exacerbates irritability, moodiness, sadness, and fatigue. Make sure you’re getting enough sleep each night. Very few people do well on less than seven hours a night. Aim for somewhere between seven to nine hours each night.

5. Stress reduction: Make changes in your life to help manage and reduce stress. Too much stress exacerbates depression and puts you at risk for future depression. Take the aspects of your life that stress you out, such as work overload or unsupportive relationships, and find ways to minimize their impact.

6. Relaxation techniques: As well as helping to relieve symptoms of depression, relaxation techniques may also reduce stress and boost feelings of joy and well-being. Try yoga, deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation.

7. Acupuncture: Acupuncture, the technique of using fine needles on specific points on the body for therapeutic purposes, is increasingly being investigated as a treatment for depression, with some research studies showing promising results. If you decide to try acupuncture, make sure that you find a licensed qualified professional.
